When traveling and accessing different establishments, it is essential for your support dog to be easily recognized. Keep in mind that everyone does not understand this type of assistance.</p>
            <p>It is recommended that your emotional support dog should wear an effectively recognizable emotional support vest for your convenience, most notably when traveling. This will help airline staff or other passengers, landlords, and other individuals in the public when searching for your ESA in case it gets lost and also helps people see that he’s more than just a pet.</p>
            <p>Although the ESA vest isn’t lawfully required, some establishments don’t allow the emotional support animals to enter. For example, the emotional support animal vest is highly recommended in the airport to avoid excessive questioning by the airline staff and help them and the other passengers to understand that your support dog will not disturb them because he was trained to be calm and well behaved. Soon, they may become a compulsory requirement for airlines, so it is good to keep your dog wearing the emotional support vest all the time. Furthermore, it is recommended that you put tags on the ESA vest of your dog stating “no petting” because there are still people who don’t understand what Emotional Support Animal ID is.</p>
            <p>It can be very diverting for your ESA to have strangers come to your pet consistently and can also diminish his ability to help you stay calm in the event of a medical emergency.

An ESA letter should signify that you have a mental disability and that your dog helps control your illness’ specific symptoms. You can take the online screening to determine if you are legible to an Emotional Support Animal.</p>`,
