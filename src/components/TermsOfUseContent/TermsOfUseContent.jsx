                                <p><strong>11. Liability</strong></p>
                                <p>We are not liable for your legal fees, damages, or expenses concerning use of the letter or your emotional support animal. We cannot and do not guarantee acceptance of our letter. Our letters are our medical and professional opinion. It is your responsibility to check with local laws and individual landlord and airline policies concerning ESAs, such as accepted breeds, and responsible use. For example, certain breeds are not accepted by certain airlines. Certain landlords require evidence that your specific ESA helps with your specific ability – this is not something that we can provide due to the limitations of telemedicine. We cannot guarantee that individual landlords and airlines will accept our letter; every business has their own policies concerning use including age restrictions, weight restrictions, and even diet and feeding restrictions. Some landlords may have restrictions on where the ESA may be kept and how. We have followed HUD guidelines to the best of our ability but our letter alone does not guarantee a diagnosis or universal acceptance. Some airlines and landlords require an ESA letter only from your on-going long term and in person doctor, which is not something we provide.</p>
